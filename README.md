# Superstore-Net Margins
#### This project uses the Superstore dataset, Superstore is a fictional online retailer based in the United States. I was inspired to do this project after completing another project,<a href="https://github.com/TyRoberts/Superstore-Regional_Overview"> Superstore-Regional Overview</a>, using the same dataset. During the initial project I noticed that the company had a lot of transactions that were generating large losses. This led me to question the overall profitability of the company, so I decided to further explore the companyâ€™s profit margins and the underlying causes of losses. 
#### I began by looking at monthly net margins and profits, January 2018 stood out. It was one of only two months in which there was a loss, and total losses in January 2018 were significantly higher than the losses in the other month. I saw this as a good starting point to discover the potential causes of the losses seen in the previous project. I then generated queries that allowed me to look at net margin and profit from the highest level, regional, to the lowest level, individual orders. In doing this I was able to find some common themes that resulted in a loss. 
#### For the analysis report I approached it from the perspective of creating a general overview in order to offer suggestions about areas that warranted further analysis. I selected this approach because conducting a full-blown analysis would require more people and produce a significantly longer report than I thought was realistic for a fictitious company. This led to the queries and statistical analysis being very basic. I look forward to using the insights I gained while conducting the analysis report in future projects, possibly looking further into the implications of Superstore's discounts.
